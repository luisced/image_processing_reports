## Abstract

NumPy (Numerical Python) is the fundamental package for scientific computing in Python. It is a Python library that provides a multidimensional array object, various derived objects (such as matrices and masked arrays), and a variety of routines for fast operations on arrays, including mathematical, logical, shape manipulation, sorting, selection, I/O, discrete Fourier transforms, basic linear algebra, basic statistical operations, random simulation, and much more. In the field of image processing and computer vision, one of the most powerful and versatile tools is OpenCV (Open Computer Vision Library). This open-source library has revolutionized how developers and researchers tackle complex problems in these fields. This report aims to provide an overview of OpenCV, its key features, and how it is contributing to the advancement of computer vision and machine learning.
