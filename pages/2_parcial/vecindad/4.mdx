# Neighborhood Excercise

## Introduction

The Neighborhood class represents a neighborhood of cells in a matrix. This class provides methods to retrieve different types of neighbors (four, eight, m-neighbors) for a given cell in the matrix.

<Steps>

### Step 1: Import Necessary Libraries

```py
from dataclasses import dataclass
from typing import List, Tuple, Set
import numpy as np
```

### Step 2: Class Definition

#### Class Definition

`matrix`
A numpy ndarray representing the matrix.

`V`
A set of integers representing specific values in the matrix.

#### Constants

`FOUR_NEIGHBORS`
Directions for the four neighbors of a cell.

`EIGHT_NEIGHBORS`
Directions for the eight neighbors of a cell.

```python showLineNumbers
@dataclass
class Neighborhood:
    matrix: np.ndarray
    V: Set[int]

    # Constants for types of neighborhoods
    FOUR_NEIGHBORS = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    EIGHT_NEIGHBORS = FOUR_NEIGHBORS + [(-1, -1), (-1, 1), (1, -1), (1, 1)]
```

#### Core Methods

`__post_init__`
Initializes the rows and columns attributes based on the shape of the matrix.

`is_within_boundaries(i, j)`
Checks if the given indices (i, j) are within the boundaries of the matrix.

`__get_neighbors(i, j, directions, apply_adjacency)`
A private method to get neighbors of a cell (i, j) based on the given directions.

`get_four_neighbors(i, j, apply_adjacency)`
Returns the four neighbors of the cell at position (i, j).

`get_eight_neighbors(i, j, apply_adjacency)`
Returns the eight neighbors of the cell at position (i, j).

`get_m_neighbors(i, j, apply_adjacency)`
Returns the m-neighbors of the cell at position (i, j) based on m-adjacency.

`adyacencia8(arreglo, punto, V)`
Returns the eight neighbors of the cell at position (i, j) based on the given adjacency set V.

`getAscciMatrix(neighbors)`
Generates an ASCII representation of the matrix with the given neighbors.

### Step 3: Usage

#### Initializing the Matrix and Class

```python

# Initialize matrix with numpy 3 x 3
matrix = np.array([
        [1, 2, 0],
        [3, 4, 5],
        [0, 6, 7]
    ])

# Initialize V
V = {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}

# Init class
neighborhood = Neighborhood(matrix, V)

```

### Step 4: Retrieving Neighbors and Displaying Results

```python
four_neighbors_with_adjacency = neighborhood.get_four_neighbors(1, 1, apply_adjacency=True)
four_neighbors_without_adjacency = neighborhood.get_four_neighbors(1, 1)

print("Four Neighbors with Adjacency:", four_neighbors_with_adjacency)
print("Four Neighbors without Adjacency:", four_neighbors_without_adjacency)
#
ascciMatrix=neighborhood.getAscciMatrix(four_neighbors_with_adjacency)

for element in ascciMatrix:
    print(element)
```

### Step 5: Output

```python
Four Neighbors with Adjacency: [(0, 1), (2, 1), (1, 0), (1, 2)]
Four Neighbors without Adjacency: [(0, 1), (2, 1), (1, 0), (1, 2)]
['+', '*', '+']
['*', 'P', '*']
['+', '*', '+']
```
